# LUMINESCENCE

# Purpose

This repository is my own custom [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) image based on [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/). This personal image is for my HTPC, but it's running the desktop variant because I use [flex-launcher](https://github.com/complexlogic/flex-launcher) as a home launcher.
